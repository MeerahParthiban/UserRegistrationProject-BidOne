**USER REGISTRATION PROJECT**

Developed Front-End using Angular 9 framework and backend using ASP.Net Core WebAPI.

**APPLICATION PROCESS**

When user tries to register, all input fields are properly validated. Once user enters valid data in the form, Submit button gets enabled. 
Angular service uses HttpPost method to submit user details to WebAPI. WebAPI controller adds the user details to a JSON File and send a successful response.
Upon successful user registration in WebAPI, application navigates to a new page with confirmation message. 
If some error occurs in registering the user, a Toaster message will be displayed.

**COMPATIBLE WITH ALL DEVICES**

Application is made responsive in all devices like Mobile devices,Ipad,Laptop using Bootstrap.

**HOSTING APPLICATION IN CLOUD**

I have deployed both Angular and WebAPI in Microsoft Azure. The link for the application is https://angularuserregistration.z13.web.core.windows.net/
